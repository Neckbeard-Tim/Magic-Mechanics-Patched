Magic Mechanics - Enhanced Invisibility
By: OperatorJack, Kurpulio and Vtastek


===Requirements===
- Morrowind
- Tribunal
- Bloodmoon
- MGE XE 0.14.0+
- MWSE 2.1+

This mod requires the most recently nightly build of MWSE. Please be sure to run the mwse-update.exe before playing this mod.

===Description===
Using Invisibility now changes the way you view the world. Instead of only becoming transparent, you see through an ethereal lens that warps and twists the environment around you. Daedra and Undead appear differently, making them distinct from other creatures around you. Please watch the video to see exactly how the new visual effects work.

This mod is inspired by the visual effects of Frodo's ring in The Lord of the Rings movies.

This mod does not use an ESP. This mod IS NOT compatible with OpenMW.

- Greatness7 for his help in programming the shader usage.
- EJ-12 for his help and advice on particles and meshes.
- Arkann : this mod uses casting and hit vfx from Magic Diversity as they look better than vanilla. In future there will be new more matching vfx for these too. These are used in the "01 - Cast VFX" package.
- Greatness7, Merlord, R-Zero and the other people over on the Morrowind Modding Discord for their help and input.
